# ML-for-Binary-Classification-and-Multi-Label-Comorbidity-Detection-of-Brain-Disorders-Using-EEG
Binary and multi-label classification using CatBoost, SHAP for interpretability, and nested cross-validation. Models generalize well across EEG features and support transparent, reliable decision-making. Designed as a foundation for future clinical tools.
